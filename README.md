Service workers help graceful degredation by allowing a website to return to a previous state if certain network functionalities like connecting to the internet fail. Graceful degredation is a design principle about building software with failsafes to avoid having the whole system crashing if one facet fo the code fails. Service workers help with loading data when the software fails to connect to a network, creating a method that allows the software to keep running in non-ideal conditions.
